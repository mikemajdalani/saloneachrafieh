              You might ask yourself where we get our confidence from, after
              browsing through our <strong>website</strong>.
            </h3>

            <p>
              We said that we can replicate all designs and all cuts, colors and
              trends. But, our barbers are so much more than
              <strong>replication machines</strong>. They are the best barbers
              in <strong>Beirut</strong> and our salon is the best salon in
              Lebanon. Let us go through a <strong>list</strong> and at the end
              of it, we will have convinced you that we do in fact hire the
              best. <strong>Here we go</strong>:
            </p>

            <div class="blog-image">
              <img
                src="../images/blogs/best-barbers-in-beirut/best-barbers-in-beirut-1.jpg"
                alt="best barbers in beirut"
              />
            </div>

            <p>
              1- Our barbers are great listeners: we all know that sometimes we
              all get overwhelmed and need someone to talk to. Our salon in
              <strong
                ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achrafieh"
                  >Achrafieh</a
                ></strong
              >
              provides a place for you to vent your heart out in a
              non-judgmental environment that guarantees
              <strong>secrecy</strong> and <strong>loyalty</strong> to the
              client. They can become your confidants and can even provide you
              with some soothing words whenever needed. They know how to lift up
              confidence and take matters off their clients' minds.
            </p>

            <p>
              2- Our barbers are <strong>good stylists</strong>: over the years,
              we have seen a great increase in the amounts of people asking our
              barbers for their opinions when it comes to matters that affect
              their styling and looks. Our hairdressers have become
              <strong>professional</strong> advice givers when it comes to
              peoples' looks and can take a look at you and instantly predict
              what goes well with your <strong>face</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              3- Our barbers are excellent <strong>trend followers</strong>:
              whenever they have any time on their hands, our barber research
              about new trends and new looks and experiment with them on each
              other. They use each other in our salon in Beirut as test subjects
              before they introduce these trends to our clients. Rest assured,
              you would never enter our salon and ask them for any
              <strong>new haircut</strong>, only to find that they have never
              heard of it.
            </p>

            <div class="blog-image">
              <img
                src="../images/blogs/best-barbers-in-beirut/best-barbers-in-beirut-2.jpeg"
                alt="best barbers in beirut"
              />
            </div>

            <p>
              4-Our barbers have a <strong>long experience</strong> and have
              undergone a lot of training: we pride ourselves on having a very
              strongly equipped staff that has been subjected to a lot of
              courses and training sessions both in hair styling and in
              <strong
                ><a href="https://www.human-communications.com"
                  >human communication</a
                ></strong
              >
              and <strong>interactions</strong>. You would never encounter a
              rude barber in our hair salon in Lebanon. You will always be
              warmly greeted and treated with the utmost respect and care.
            </p>

            <p>
              5- Our barbers believe that you know what you want and need more
              than they do: sometimes, our barbers know what suits your look
              more than you do and they are glad to provide advice about that.
              However, in our salon, we do believe that you are entitled to your
              <strong>own opinion</strong> and would never
              <strong>judge you</strong> for any look you choose to sport. After
              all, we sometimes do not know your reasons for doing so and cannot
              understand whether that might have deeper meanings to you! After
              all, <strong>it's only hair</strong>, we can always fix it don't
              worry! We have got your back and we believe in your taste and
              decisions! <strong>You know you best!</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              6- Our barbers are a part of the lovely
              <strong
                ><a href="../best-atmosphere-in-barber-shops"
                  >atmosphere in our barber shop in Beirut</a
                ></strong
              >: we at <em>Salon E Achrafieh</em> have prided ourselves with the
              fact that our atmosphere is that of friendship, kindness, and
              sophistication. Our barbers are a huge part of making that
              atmosphere shine through. They ooze with class and respect, yet
              they never treat the clients with anything but understanding and
              politeness.
            </p>

            <p>
              7- Our barbers insist on always researching and finding the
              <strong
                ><a href="https://www.saloniris.com/12-salon-products/"
                  >best products</a
                ></strong
              >
              to use with their clients: you are never going to find another
              hairdresser in Achrafieh who has staff with as much integrity and
              care as our barbers have. They would never allow products to be
              used on their clients heads and faces unless they are coming from
              well <strong>renowned brands</strong> and are tested and agreed
              upon by the entire team.
            </p>

            <div class="blog-image">
              <img

                alt="best barbers in beirut"
              />
            </div>

            <p>
              8- Our barbers know how much the hair can have an impact on one's
              <strong>life and psychiatry</strong>: we have the best barbers in
              Beirut! Not just because of their skills, but they have been doing
              this for so long, that they have developed an understanding of why
              people choose to change their <strong>hairstyles</strong> and how
              that decision
              <a
                href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201505/what-your-hair-really-says-about-you"
                >will affect them mentally</a
              >. They have learned to anticipate that and to sooth any potential
              anxiety that their clients might be experiencing.
            </p>

            <p>
              9- Our barbers respect your <em>time</em> and always serve their
              clients right away based on their <strong>appointments</strong>:
              in our hair salon, you don't need to wait for hours until your
              preferred barber is free to give you a haircut. You call ahead and
              you
              <strong
                ><a href="https://g.page/saloneachrafieh?share"
                  >book an appointment</a
                ></strong
              >
              and we sure will respect that appointment and respect your time.
            </p>

            <p>
              10- Our barbers have <strong>"green hands"</strong> as they say:
              after visiting our barber shop in Beirut and acquiring a haircut,
              you are going to notice that your hair and your beard are always
              going to be growing in a <strong>faster rate</strong> than they
              used to. This is because our barbers know how to cut the hair at
              the right angles and use <strong>professional tools</strong> to
              protect the hair tiny ends from
              <strong
                ><a href="https://www.byrdie.com/how-to-prevent-split-ends"
                  >damage during the cut</a
                ></strong
              >.
            </p>

            <div class="blog-image">
              <img

              />
            </div>

            <h3><strong>In summary,</strong></h3>

            <p>
              our barbers deserve to be <strong>congratulated</strong> for their
              hard work that has transformed our salon in Achrafieh into the
              haven that it is now! They have made
              <strong><a href="../">Salon E Achrafieh</a></strong>
              the number one barber shop in Achrafieh and are working on taking
              our name to international fields, especially with us
