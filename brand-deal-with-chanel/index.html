              In general, people associate <strong>Chanel</strong> with the
              elite of woman's' fashion, same as they associate us with the
              <strong>best hairdressing</strong> salons in Lebanon. But, you
              would be surprised to discover that it also includes products for
              <strong>men</strong> as well. It is no secret that Lebanese people
              are always in love with brands and showing them off. But, when it
              comes to men's products–
              <em>especially those for shaving and their perfumes</em>– the
              <strong>consumer</strong> searches for quality before brand name.
            </p>

            <div class="blog-image">

            <p>
              The products of <strong>Chanel</strong> have reached a perfect
              balance between quality and grace and have elevated the skin care
              products industry into a whole new level. These products include a
              product called
              <strong
                ><a
                  href="https://www.chanel.com/us/fragrance/men/c/7x1x2x34/bleu-de-chanel/"
                  >Bleu De Chanel</a
                ></strong
              >. This product line contains a shaving cream and a shaving gel
              for men as well as a perfume and an
              <strong

                  >Eau De Toilette</a
                ></strong
              >. The shaving cream provides an easy comfortable close shaving
              experience while its clear gel offers a perfect visibility of the
              beard line during shaving for a precise, controlled cut. Together,
              they elevate the shaving experience and provide you with a
              professional facial hair trimming look at home and leave an
              amazing smell that lasts more than 24 hours.

              As for the perfume and the Eau De Toilette, they speak for
              themselves.

              It is our pleasure to announce that Chanel has chosen

              as its <strong>brand ambassador</strong> and has provided us with
              the exclusive rights to import, promote and sell it.

            <p>
              Based on this brand deal, we have made an event in

              >, <strong>ABC Verdun</strong>, <strong>ABC Dbayeh</strong> in
              <strong>June 2019</strong>, as well to promote these products and
              introduce them to that Lebanese consumer. We have always been in
              contact with brands like <strong>Chanel</strong>,

              And we are proud to say that our many year long importations and
              interactions with international companies for skin and hair care
              products have finally shined through and gave these companies a
              lot of faith to grant us this deal.
            </p>

            <p>
              We like to think that <strong>Chanel</strong> took their time and
              searched for the <strong>best barber shops in Beirut</strong> and
              found out that we have the best barbers in Lebanon. We also like
              to attribute this success to our amazing communications team and
              to our managers who have worked long and hard to transform this
              salon into the best salon in Beirut and Lebanon.
