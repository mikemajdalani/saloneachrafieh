            <h4>In the section of short length haircuts,</h4>

            <p>
              there is a general trend this year of making the hair shorter on
              one part of the head compared to the other. For example, in the
              <strong

                  >crew cut</a
                ></strong
              >, the hair is tall on the upper side of the head, yet shorter on
              the sides and the back. Similar designs can be

                ></strong
              >, the disconnected undercut, and the low, mid and high faded

              hair fashion. And finally, there are other short hairstyles that
              are not as popular as the previous one but are seen this year
              nonetheless. These include the

            <h4>In the section of medium length haircuts,</h4>

            <p>
              there exist hairstyles for people who like to experiment with
              longer hair but still wish to look professional in the office. For
              these men, there is <strong>one</strong> barber shop in
              <strong>Beirut</strong> that can understand and achieve that
              balance! <strong><a href="../">Our shop!</a></strong> We

              or a quaff that can make you appear sophisticated yet playful at
              the same time. However, if you have a medium length hair but wish
              to follow the trend of unsymmetrical hair distribution, you can
              get

                ></strong
              >, which is practically a crew cut but for medium length hair. For
              more classical haircuts, you can get messy waves, a fringe, or a
              comb over. But, if you want to look <strong>edgier</strong>, you
              can go with a <strong>faux hawk</strong>, or a
              <strong>head part</strong>.

            <h4>Finally, in the section of long length haircuts,</h4>

            <p>
              nothing defeats the long loose waves or curls. However, some men
              may prefer to having <strong>long straight hair</strong> and some
              would choose to part it to one side. As to the styling of long
              hair, some prefer to keep it loose, while others choose to makes
              it into a

              combination of <strong>both</strong>. But, keep in mind that
              dealing with long hair is not that easy and requires the utter
              most care of the <strong>best barbers</strong> we have!

              This year's trend in men's hair color includes the following:
            </h4>

            <p>
              platinum waves, purple and pink, smoky grey curls, multi-coloring,

              and thanks to our amazing hairstylists have found the perfect way
              to pair them with their new hair styles and haircuts. Our barbers
              have found a way to make men comfortable in wearing these bands by
              adding a sense of <strong>masculinity</strong> into the haircut
              and making it <strong>sleek</strong> and <strong>edgy</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              At <strong>Salon E Achrafieh</strong>, our philosophy is that a
              good hairdresser is supposed to style the hair in a way that
              allows the client to transform it at home from disheveled after
              sleep to perfectly looking in a matter of seconds.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is what a good barber in Beirut does. He transforms hair
              dressing from a job to a service, where people use this service to
              make their lives <strong>easier</strong>. We consider it a huge
              success when a large portion of our clients tell us that since
              they visited our salon. They have found it a lot easier to wake up
              in the morning and <strong>simply</strong> dress their hair with a
              light brushing and then head to their work. It is an
              <strong>honor</strong> really to be a part of our client lives and
              we hope to become a part of your <strong>success</strong> story
              too.
