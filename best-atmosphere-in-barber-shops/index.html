            <p>
              Our salon, proudly classified amongst the
              <strong>best hairstyling salons</strong> in Beirut, provides a
              location for you to let go of your

              >. When searching for a "<em>Lebanese hairdresser near me</em>" we
              know that you don't have a lot of time to waste, and would like to
              find a place that is <strong>comforting</strong> and
              <strong>upbeat</strong>. We provide you with that using our

              TV entertainment, and finally, some well needed air conditioning.
              It is bad enough that it is that hot outside!
            </p>

            <p>
              Don't you hate it when you go into a salon, and it's named the
              "<strong>best barber shop in Lebanon</strong>" and when it is time
              for you to leave: you are all covered in sweat! Sometimes you have
              to go to an
              <a href="https://www.lebtivity.com/">event</a> directly from there
              and sometimes your hair get moist from all that sweat and an hour
              later you look like a wet towel. Well, be comforted in the fact
              that our air conditioning is very up and running! You might even
              think of getting a sweater with you the next time you visit our
              barbershop.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Don't worry though</strong>, as in the winter, our shop is
              also equipped with a state of the art

              salon in <strong>Achrafieh</strong> is not a place where you go
              and feel like you are spending your hard earned money on
              unnecessary things. Once you leave the shop, you will never regret
              it! It is money well spent, with top of the art barber experience,
              best product quality, and best human interactions.

            <p>
              We pride ourselves on having top of the
              <strong>batch products</strong> with international brands and
              equipment. We have even chosen by <strong>Chanel</strong> to
              represent them and promote their products across
              <strong><a href="https://www.abc.com.lb/">ABC</a></strong
              >'s branches in <strong>Lebanon</strong>. This is due to our hard
              work and interactions with international brand ambassadors and
              also due to our huge amount of importation of products from such
              brands.

              We have created a friendly atmosphere for chatter and laughter:
            </h4>

            <p>
              Besides being the number one barber shop in
              <strong>Beirut</strong>, we have really worked on building
              personal relationships with our clients. We have been open in
              Achrafieh since long time and have clients who have been visiting
              our shop for decades. Our clients are <strong>loyal</strong> and
              have become <strong>friends</strong> as many of them plan to visit
              the shop on the same day of the week or month. We pride ourselves
              as the ones who have fostered these relationships and allowed them
              to grow in an atmosphere of love and trust.
            </p>

            <h4>We are always on time with your appointments:</h4>

            <p>
              Don't you hate it when you go to barber shops in Lebanon and they
              never <strong>respect</strong> the
              <strong>appointment</strong> that they gave you? You sit there for
              hours as if waiting in line to get some of the attention of the
              barber. Well, sometimes you don't have <strong>time</strong> to
              wait, and sometimes, you are not in the mood to
              <strong>wait</strong>. That is why we respect our appointments and
              give you the exact time at which you will be pampered. However,
              some of our clients like to wait around in the shop, even if their
              hair styling was done.
            </p>

            <p>
              As mentioned earlier, we have provided them with an environment
              and sit back and relax and chat away. All in all, there are a lot
              of components that make for an amazing salon
              <strong>experience</strong>. A lot of these components have been
              established and implemented. After all, hairstyling is supposed to
              be a <strong>luxurious</strong> thing to have, and our clients
              deserve the have the full pampering experience.
            </p>

              We at Salon E Achrafieh
