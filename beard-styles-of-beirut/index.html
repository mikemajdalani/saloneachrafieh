              It is no secret that the past few years have seen an increase in
              beard <strong>trends</strong> and <strong>designs</strong>.
            </h2>

            <p>
              People have been affected by TV shows whose main characters have
              extravagant beard designs and ooze with sophistication,
              masculinity and sex appeal. These include the TV show "<strong
                ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hayba"
                  >Al Hayba</a
                ></strong
              >" for example. This show has drug and weapon smugglers and
              dealers that are portrayed as <strong>heroes</strong> for some
              reason. Anyway, they have picked a very good looking actor to play
              the main character and he has a <strong>full beard</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Due to the extent of love that people had for this character, they
              developed a love for beards and it soon became a
              <strong>trend</strong> for people to want the exact same design.
              In our salon in <strong>Achrafieh</strong>, we have personally
              seen this trend set in motion.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Before we get into that, let us name some of the iconic beard
              designs that have dominated the year 2019.
            </h3>

            <p>
              First of all, you have to make a choice whether you prefer a
              <strong>short</strong> or a <strong>long</strong> beard. If you
              desire a short beard, you can choose the level of fade that you
              would like to have and the blending design from it into the
              <strong>sideburns</strong>. This fading design includes a lot of
              different ways to incorporate a fading tone between the hairline
              and the sideburns as well as the mustache.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some people choose to have a look of head baldness but with a
              large beard while others like to have them equally voluptuous. It
              is a common knowledge by now –
              <em>if you are a frequent reader of our blogs</em>– that man buns
              were a trend these last years. And with these
              <strong>buns</strong>, you can choose to have a long or they can
              choose to trim it closely to show a look of sharpness and
              neatness. And as a blast from the past, this year has seen a trend
              in goatees and in
              <strong
                ><a href="https://beardoholic.com/van-dyke/"
                  >Van Dyke beards</a
                ></strong
              >
              and
              <strong
                ><a href="https://www.dmarge.com/2017/03/beard-styles.html"
                  >rugged beards</a
                ></strong
              >.
            </p>

            <h4>
              These have been around for decades but have not lost their charm.
            </h4>

            <p>
              However, the trendiest one of them all is the one that goes in
              with the crew cut and is a faded design that thins out as it gets
              closer to the side burns. This is the look that was marketed by
              the main character of "<strong>Al Hayba</strong>" and seems to be
              going strong this year so far. Whatever your choice of beard is,
              we at
              <strong><a href="../">Salon E Achrafieh</a></strong>
              have the set of skills as the best beard trimmers and hairdressers
              in <strong>Beirut</strong> to reproduce the design.
            </p>

            <p>
              Same as the hair goes, men this year
              <strong>colored</strong> their beards as well. However, they don't
              tend to go crazy with these colors. Most of the times, men want to
              look <strong>younger</strong>, so they dye over their graying
              beard and hair to <strong>reverse</strong> back time. In
              <strong>Salon E</strong> in Beirut, we provide time turning
              services as well as trending beard coloring hacks.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, some young men and teenage boys like to give their
              beards some highlights or some
              <strong
                ><a
                  href="https://www.pinterest.com/thomassantomartino/silver-beards/"
                  >silver ends</a
                ></strong
              >. These don't last on their faces for a long time; they are just
              a look to sport for a while for a certain
              <strong>event or party</strong>. Some men like to change the shade
              of their hair and facial hair even if they weren't experiencing
              hair graying.
            </p>

            <p>
              They like to experiment with lighter or darker colors. We at Salon
              E Achrafieh have the best barbers in <strong>Lebanon</strong> to
              provide consultancies on these matters and the best salon in
              Beirut to <strong>execute</strong> them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another <strong>aspect</strong> of beard trimming and care is the
              fact that they need a lot of <strong>maintenance</strong> at home,
              especially for <strong>long</strong> beards.
            </p>

            <p>
              We pride ourselves for being the <strong>best salon</strong> to
              provide an experience that can improve your
              <strong>grooming</strong> practices at home. For example, we
              provide our clients who wish to sport a long beard with treatments
              and hair products that allow the beard to remain straight and need
              only a few strokes from a brush at home. After all, the client
              cannot come to the salon each day to redo their beard styling.
            </p>

            <div class="blog-image">

            <h4>
              Another aspect of beard designing and trimming is mustache design.
            </h4>

            <p>
              In our salon we have the best hairdressers in Lebanon to
              <strong>draw</strong> and <strong>curve</strong> your mustaches.
              Surprisingly, 2019 said that every mustache design is acceptable
              to have, starting from the
              <strong
                ><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/330381322654925330/"
                  >Chevron design</a
                ></strong
              >
              that is an old school dad mustache design. However, a more
              eccentric one is called
              <strong
                ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handlebar_moustache"
                  >the handlebar mustache</a
                ></strong
              >; it is very distinctive and hard to pull off.
            </p>

            <p>
              A walrus mustache on the other hand is almost broom like and
              covers the upper lip. It resembles that pulled off by American old
              school police officers. Another one is the
              <strong
                ><a
                  href="https://gillette.com/en-us/shaving-tips/facial-hair-styles/how-to-shave-horseshoe-mustache"
                  >horseshoe mustache</a
                ></strong
              >
              that goes all the way down to the chin. And finally there is the
              English mustache style that looks like the walrus one but does not
              cover the upper lip. These are the most common these year and the
              most practiced by our barbers in <strong>Beirut</strong>. But, we
              have the best barbers in Beirut and they can replicate any look
              you want.
